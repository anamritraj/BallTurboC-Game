## BallTurboC-Game
This is a simple game made in C++ using the graphics library. Name of the game is “CUBER”. 

Objective of the game is to take the cube from left side to the right side without hitting any of the balls which are coming from top-right to bottom-left.  

Balls are generated randomly at one of the two edges and once they reach left or bottom wall, they are regenerated with random positions at right or top wall. Thus, the movement of balls is all random.  The cube moves using the left and right arrow keys. You can move the cube back and forth. Once you reach the other end. You will be presented with a new tougher level. Actually, in the even levels Number of balls are increased by 10 and in odd levels speed of balls is increased by 50%.Feel free to modify and add new features!
